# If specified, the Wrapper will be run as the specified user.

# IMPORTANT - Make sure that the user has the required privileges to write

#  the PID file and wrapper.log files.  Failure to be able to write the log

#  file will cause the Wrapper to exit without any way to write out an error

#  message.

# NOTE - This will set the user which is used to run the Wrapper as well as

#  the JVM and is not useful in situations where a privileged resource or

#  port needs to be allocated prior to the user being changed.
